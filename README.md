## Description
Surprisingly I actually had a lot of difficulties with this one. For some reason every time I would try to deploy to heroku it would delete my local files. Finally managed to figure it out though. This is my note taker that uses Express.js that will save, retrieve, and delete note data from your JSON file.
## Usage
You can follow this [link](https://note-taking-app-ac.herokuapp.com/) to use the note taking app
